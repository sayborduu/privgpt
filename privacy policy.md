# Privacy Policy

Last updated: June 14, 2023

This Privacy Policy describes how PrivGPT collects, uses, and protects your personal information when you use our website and services. By using our website, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.

## What kind of personal information does PrivGPT collect from users?

PrivGPT uses @vercel/analytics (free) to analyze traffic. The information collected includes your browser name, referrer, country, and operating system. Additionally, we may collect information about your chats with any AI, but this data is saved on your device and you're the only one that can read that data.

## How does PrivGPT use the personal information it collects?

The personal information collected through analytics is mainly used to improve how our website and services function per browser, operating system, and other factors.

## Does PrivGPT share personal information with third parties? If so, who?

When you send text to any AI, the information will be shared with the corresponding AI maintainer. For example, text sent to gpt-4 goes to OpenAI, Bard to Google, and gpt-4-poe to Poe. There may be more models, and this information is only used to generate a chat response for you.

## How does PrivGPT protect the security of personal information?

PrivGPT takes your privacy seriously. We save chats on your device and do not share any information without your permission. For example, there's a share button in conversations for you to use if you wish.

No account is required to use PrivGPT.

Third parties might save the information for a limited time, but since you're using PrivGPT, the information won't be related to you, making it impossible for them to know your identity.

## What are users' rights with respect to their personal information?

You have the right to erase cookies, effectively making it as if you never used the website.

## How can users contact PrivGPT with questions or concerns about privacy?

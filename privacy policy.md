Last updated: June 18, 2023

This Privacy Policy describes how PrivGPT collects, uses, and protects your personal information when you use our website and services. By using our website, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.

## Google Analytics

This website uses Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google, Inc. ("Google"). Google Analytics uses "cookies", which are text files placed on your computer, to help the website analyze how users use the site. The information generated by the cookie about your use of the website (including your IP address) will be transmitted to and stored by Google on servers in the United States.

Google will use this information for the purpose of evaluating your use of the website, compiling reports on website activity for website operators, and providing other services relating to website activity and internet usage. Google may also transfer this information to third parties where required to do so by law, or where such third parties process the information on Google's behalf. Google will not associate your IP address with any other data held by Google. Google Analytics data is retained for a period of 2 months.

## User Data Collection Acknowledgement

By using our website and services, you acknowledge that your data may be collected and processed for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy.

## What kind of personal information does PrivGPT collect from users?

PrivGPT uses @vercel/analytics (free) and Google Analytics to analyze traffic. The information collected includes your browser name, referrer, country, and operating system. Additionally, we may collect information about your chats with any AI, but this data is saved on your device and you're the only one that can read that data. Google Analytics helps us understand how users interact with our website and enables us to improve the user experience. To learn more about how Google Analytics collects and processes data, please visit [https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/](https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/).

*Data Retention:* The information collected through Google Analytics is retained for a period of 2 months.

## How does PrivGPT use the personal information it collects?

The personal information collected through analytics is mainly used to improve how our website and services function per browser, operating system, and other factors.

## Does PrivGPT share personal information with third parties? If so, who?

When you send text to any AI, the information will be shared with the corresponding AI maintainer. For example, text sent to gpt-4 goes to OpenAI, Bard to Google, and gpt-4-poe to Poe. There may be more models, and this information is only used to generate a chat response for you.

## How does PrivGPT protect the security of personal information?

PrivGPT takes your privacy seriously. We save chats on your device and do not share any information without your permission. For example, there's a share button in conversations for you to use if you wish.

No account is required to use PrivGPT or in most imalexbfs.ml pages/subdomains.

Third parties might save the information for a limited time, but since you're using PrivGPT, the information won't be related to you, making it impossible for them to know your identity.

## What are users' rights with respect to their personal information?

You have the right to erase cookies, effectively making it as if you never used the website.

## How can users contact PrivGPT with questions or concerns about privacy?
